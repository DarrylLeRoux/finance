          <h1>Legally Binding!</h1>
          <p>
            This is a legally binding contract between Chantelle Le Roux, and
            Darryl Le Roux. There will be no entering out of this contract when
            you close this modal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Know that this was done when Darryl Le Roux was meant to relax from
            coding, but instead decided to do this to hopefully make you smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            This binding contract is payable on the 25th November 2023, or
            unless a miracle happens. This would be truly appreciated, as Darryl
            Le Roux forgot that he had to spend R1980 on a pair of jeans, a top
            and a belt in order to go to Standard Bank for meetings. He still
            has clothes that were previously purchased, but alas, they are too
            small. This is also due to the fact that he has now gone to Standard
            Bank on Monday's and Friday's when he is meant to be working from
            home, and has spent an additional R900 on petrol so far - with more
            meetings from the 10th of November, until Neil decides that they can
            be done online.
          </p>
          <p>So close the modal, and enjoy the little show.</p>
          <p>PS: You may also click no for a surprise :)</p>
